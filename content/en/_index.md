Hello! My name is Yi Zhu (Aria). I am a communication researcher interested in public opinion, digital activism, science communication, and computational communication. 

My research seeks to answer a central question: How can the public leverage emerging media technologies (e.g., AI-driven chatbots, social media, online communities, digital platforms) to communicate effectively and achieve meaningful outcomes for the social good?

Methodologically, I utilize digital footprint data (so-called "big data") in combination with "smaller data" collected from surveys and interviews. I am enthusiastic about exploring computational methods and mixed methods approaches.

*I am currently applying for PhD programs in Communication for Fall 2026.*
